# SH004/checkbox-state

## Description

`SH004` enforces task checkbox state from frontmatter-defined document state conditions.

Each configured condition maps frontmatter states to an expected checkbox state:

- `checked: true` means all task checkboxes must be checked (`[x]`/`[X]`).
- `checked: false` means all task checkboxes must be unchecked (`[ ]`).

## Failing Example

```markdown
---
status: ready-for-review
state_reason: success
---

- [ ] finalize acceptance criteria
```

## Passing Example

```markdown
---
status: proposed
lifecycle: draft
---

- [ ] draft task intentionally open
```

## Configuration

- `scan_fenced_code` (`boolean`, default `false`): include task checkboxes inside fenced code blocks.
- `conditions` (`array`): ordered condition list; first matching condition wins.
  - `states` (`object`): frontmatter key to expected value (`string` or `string[]`).
  - `checked` (`boolean`): expected checkbox state when the condition matches.

```yaml
scan_fenced_code: false
conditions:
  - states:
      status: ready-for-review
      state_reason: completed
    checked: true
  - states:
      lifecycle: draft
      status: proposed
    checked: false
```

## Notes

- Condition matching is case-insensitive.
- A condition matches only when all its `states` entries match (logical AND).
- Use multiple conditions to express logical OR across different state combinations.
- If `conditions` is omitted/empty, or no condition matches, the rule is a no-op.
